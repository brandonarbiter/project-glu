The intial focus is on data from the Dexcom G4, but later I'd like to include carbs, insulin, and activity data.\r\n\r\ncurrent status\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nI have a [forked](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/original-android-cgm) version of [@jcostik](https://twitter.com/jcostik)'s [original-android-app](https://github.com/hackingtype1/original-android-cgm) running on a Moto G and have it posting simple json to [this](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/project-glu) web app, I'm planing to replace this with a locally running instance of the [tidepool platform](http://tidepool.org/platform/).\r\n\r\nI have the android app posting to the web app running locally and at AWS so that I can test changes in more controlled way.\r\n\r\nI also have a [forked](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/cgm-remote-monitor) version of [NightScout](https://github.com/rnpenguin/cgm-remote-monitor) that uses the same mongo db as the basic web-app. \r\n\r\nnext steps\r\n----------\r\n\r\nTracking ideas/progress on [trello](https://trello.com/b/k8dwYmAI/project-glu)\r\n\r\n-[@jasoncalabrese](https://twitter.com/jasoncalabrese)\r\n","google":"UA-49303606-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
