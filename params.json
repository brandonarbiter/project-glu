The intial focus is on data from the Dexcom G4, but later I'd like to include carbs, insulin, and activity data.\r\n\r\ncurrent status\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nI have a [forked](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/original-android-cgm) version of [@jcostik](https://twitter.com/jcostik)'s [original-android-app](https://github.com/hackingtype1/original-android-cgm) running on a Moto G and have it posting simple json to [this](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/project-glu) web app, I'm planing to replace this with a locally running instance of the [tidepool platform](http://tidepool.org/platform/).\r\n\r\nI also have a [forked](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/cgm-remote-monitor) version of [NightScout](https://github.com/rnpenguin/cgm-remote-monitor) that uses the same mongo db as the basic web-app\r\nand a [forked](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/cgm-pebble) version of [cgm-pebble](https://github.com/hackingtype1/cgm-pebble) that connects to the project-glu endpoint to display the current BG value on a Pebble watch.\r\n\r\n**For quick, easy, and repeatable deploys I'm using vagrant.\r\nTo give it a try follow these steps:**\r\n\r\n  1. clone repo `git clone https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/project-glu.git; cd project-glu`\r\n  1. [install vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html)\r\n  1. setup a [digital ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=78da7dabdaf4) account: use promo code 'SSDMAY10' for 2 free months - **link includes my referral code**\r\n  1. install https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-digitalocean\r\n  1. configure dropbox: https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader\r\n  1. Set ENV VARS\r\n    * use the Digital Ocean [api page](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/api_access) to find your values for: DO_CLIENT_ID, DO_API_KEY\r\n    * `DB_CONF=\"/Users/<YOU>/.dropbox_uploader\"` OR `DB_CONF=\"/home/<YOU>/.dropbox_uploader\"`\r\n  1. `vagrant up --provider=digital_ocean` and wait (I'm using a mac and have no idea if this would/could work from windows)\r\n  1. done\r\n\r\n**Running the `vagrant up` command above should have:**\r\n\r\n* launched an brand new server at digitalocean, called a droplet ($5/month)\r\n* installed node, mongo, git, nginx, etc\r\n* cloned all the required repos\r\n* ran the required setups: npm, bower, grunt, etc\r\n* downloaded a backup from your dropbox (if configured)\r\n* started everything\r\n* installed a cron script that runs nightly to backup data to dropbox\r\n\r\n**Once all of that is done and assuming there were now big errors you should be able to:**\r\n\r\n_In links below replace YOUR_DROPLET_IP with the IP address of your droplet, this should be one of the last lines after running `vagrant up` or you can find it at [digital ocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets)_\r\n\r\n* See [NightScout running on your brand new droplet](http://YOUR_DROPLET_IP:1337)\r\n* See [the Project-Glu login on your droplet](http://YOUR_DROPLET_IP)\r\n* And if those work, update the Android uploader so it can start uploading to you're new droplet (more info comming later)\r\n\r\n\r\nnext steps\r\n----------\r\n\r\nTracking ideas/progress on [trello](https://trello.com/b/k8dwYmAI/project-glu)\r\n\r\n-[@jasoncalabrese](https://twitter.com/jasoncalabrese)\r\n","google":"UA-49303606-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
