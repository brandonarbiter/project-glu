Project-Glu
===========

Project Glu is some glue that brings together data from the G4, and hopefully pump/activity tracker data

current status
--------------

I have a [forked](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/original-android-cgm) version of [@jcostik](https://twitter.com/jcostik)'s [original-android-app](https://github.com/hackingtype1/original-android-cgm) running on my old/rooted Galaxy Nexus(gnex) and have it posting simple json to [this](https://github.com/jasoncalabrese/project-glu) node.js/express.js/angular.js/mongo app.

I have the node app running locally right now but will probably move it to AWS soon.

The biggest issue that I'm facing now is getting the G4 to stop draining the battery from my gnex so that it will at least last all night.  I may just buy a Moto G, since the battery on my gnex was never good anyway.

next steps

Currently tracking ideas/progress on [trello](https://trello.com/b/k8dwYmAI/project-glu)
